    <h1>Animation</h1>
    
<body>
<p>Dr. B was able to get the sweet, sweet animations working in class through the use of transitions in D3. These transitions are based off one line of code, and that is the .transition(). From the .transition(), he must likely utilized the  .duration() that specifies the amount of time for a transition to take place in milliseconds. He might have even added in a .ease() to control the smoothness or choppiness of the transition. I cannot quite remember if any of his animations were delayed or not, but he could have very well used the .delay() in order to specify when the transition begins. Furthermore, he  could have taken advantage of the .on() that can be used to mark the start and end of a transition. He did it using similar features to that I just used in order to get this circle to change. (Refresh page if you missed it)</p>
